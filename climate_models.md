# Math of climate

In the rest of this article we want to answer those questions:  
1. Why we can't forcast weather as we do for the motion of a planet?

## Equations of the atmosphere
Let's start from the second Netwton's law in the differential form:
$$ \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{F}{m}$$

Now let's consider the velocity vector in a three dimensional space $V_a$  
where the index $a$ stands for _absolute_ meaning that the velocity is 
considered respect to an absolute reference system

$$\frac{d_a V_a}{dt} = \frac{F}{m} $$ (1)

and $M = \frac{F}{m}$ is the force for unit of mass.

Since we want to consider the Hearth system, ignoring the motion of revolution, we consider the rotation of the planet arounf his axis.  
Denting by $\Omega$ the angular speed, $V$ the speed relative to a system solidal with the Hearth and $r$ the position respect to the cenetr of the planet:
$$ V_a = V + \Omega \times r (\#eq_velocity_com)$$
> Example
The following equality holds for any vector $V_a$ of the form (#eq_velocity_com):
> $\frac{d_a V_a}{dt} = \frac{d_a V_a}{dt} + \Omega \times  V_a (\#eq_newton)$$

Then (\#eq_newton) becames
